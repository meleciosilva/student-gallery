# Student Gallery

This project displays a student roster and their information, useful for networking and communication purposes.

## Description

This project is a student gallery that displays a number of students and their respective name, photo, email address, and date of registration. This project supports any number of students once their information is input into the program. The pagination buttons are located on the bottom of each page to browse additional students. This version of the project displays only nine students per page.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply load the program on the Google Chrome browser. The first page of nine students will automatically load on your browser. To display more students, click the numbered buttons on the bottom of the screen. Each numbered button functions to display up to nine more additional students and their information.

## Help

You will notice a search box on the top of the page when loading the project. While it does allow text entry, it does not search and/or filter students at this time. Continue to manually search for students using the pagination buttons on the bottom of the screen.
