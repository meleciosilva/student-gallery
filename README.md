# Student Gallery

This project displays a student roster and their information, useful for networking and communication purposes.

## Description

This project is a student gallery that displays a number of students and their respective name, photo, email address, and date of registration. This project supports any number of students once their information is input into the program. This version of the project displays only nine students per page. Pagination buttons are located on the bottom of each page to browse additional students on different pages. This project also features a search box to help filter your search for specific students listed in the program.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply load the program on the Google Chrome browser. The first page of nine students will automatically load on your browser. To display more students, you can click the numbered buttons on the bottom of the screen. Each numbered button functions to display up to nine more additional students and their information. Alternatively, you can filter the students displayed by keying in their name in the search box.

## Help

You may notice an error message appear with using the search box. This message appears when your search input does not match any of the students' names in the program. To continue using this program, simply delete your search input and the page will display all the students again.
